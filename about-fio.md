    The Foundation for Interwallet Operability is a industry consortia, consisting of leading wallets, exchanges, crypto payment processors, and various other entities and community members dedicated to the pursuit of blockchain usability through the FIO Protocol.

    The Foundation is a Cayman-registered nonprofit, and includes a Board of Directors that consist of multiple industry leaders.

    **Managing Director: [Luke Stokes](https://twitter.com/lukestokes)**

    The Foundation intends to operate as a Decentralized Autonomous Consortia in the future, with many active members of the community contributing value to the project.

    At this current stage, FIO is primarily supported by a single service provider â€“ **[Dapix](https://dapix.io/)**, which helped build the first version of the FIO Protocol. A full list of their employees is available on their website.
