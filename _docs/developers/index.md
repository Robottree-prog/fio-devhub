# FIO Developers Guide

The developers guide is built to support developers wanting to integrate with the FIO protocol.

### Contributing Code

[Branching and release]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/developers/git)

TBD (Eric): Need to copy in info from: https://github.com/fioprotocol/fio/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md (and link to devhub from that page)
TBD (Eric): Need to update: https://github.com/fioprotocol/fio.contracts

### Versioning

TBD (Eric): Need to finish versioning document

### API Endpoints

TBD (Ed): Explain process for adding getters. (I think we should not create action API endpoints unless specifically requested. Instead use push transaction.)

### Contract Development 

TBD (Ed): Explain ABI, Tables, RAM, Fees, etc. and give examples

Can reference pages under: https://developers.fioprotocol.io/docs/integration-guide/ (and we can rework these pages...)

### Permisions 

TBD (Ed): Specific page on permissions since this spans both fio chain and contracts? Or just mix this in. Can reference: https://developers.fioprotocol.io/docs/fio-protocol/keys-accounts
